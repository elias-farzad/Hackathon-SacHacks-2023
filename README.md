# [SacHacks 2023](https://sachacks.io/): LyricLink
- LyricLink is a full stack application using Django, React, HTML & CSS.
- It acts as a forum that sorts through the top 100 songs on Billboard. Users can leave thoughts and comments on the songs. 

### My Personal Experience
I did this Hackathon with 3 other teammates. We  decided to use a tech stack we had very little experience with, as we wanted to make this a learning experience. I worked directly on the backend logging system that creates new users and allows them login and logout.

It was my first time coding an actual application in Python, and especially using the Django framework since it had it's own backend and authentication system. This was a great first experience, even if it was stressful and sleep-deprived. I enjoyed working with the backend more than the front-end or any of the other systems that were part of the project. 

I learned that I do enjoy working on the backend side of the project, being my first time trying it. It was exciting to connect my previous unlinked knowledge with the documentation for Django, and creating something that actually worked in the end. I look forward to more personal projects using similar frameworks and creating full-stack applications that will contribute something to society as well as teach me a thing or two.

### How To Run
1. Extract ZIP file
2. Open any terminal 
3. Change Directories into the Frontend folder
4. Type 'npm start'. You should now see the website :)
5. To link with backend, change directories into the Backend folder, and type 'python manage.py runserver'
